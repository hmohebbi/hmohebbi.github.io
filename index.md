I'm a __Master__'s student in Artificial Intelligence at [Iran University of Science and Technology](http://www.iust.ac.ir).
I'm happy to be supervised by [Mohammad Taher Pilehvar](https://pilehvar.github.io/).

My main research interest is __Natural Language Processing__, with a particular interest in analyzing and interpreting neural language models.

Previously, I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Ferdowsi University of Mashhad](https://en.um.ac.ir/). During that, I was working under the supervision of [Ahad Harati](http://a.harati.profcms.um.ac.ir/) as a team member of the [Nexus](http://nexus.um.ac.ir/) RoboCup Simulation Team.
